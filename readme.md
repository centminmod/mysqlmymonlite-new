# What is mysqlmymonlite.sh  ? 

* http://mysqlmymon.com

mysqlmymonlite.sh is lite version of extensive featured mysqlmymon.sh - MySQL 
and system monitoring script written by George Liu (eva2000) vbtechsupport.com 
for quick stats check for apache, nginx and mysql stats for CentOS WHM/Cpanel,
CentOS and Debian 6.x systems. 

mysqlmymon.sh is the big brother script to mysqlmymonlite.sh which is much more
feature extensive and used for my private paid consults I do - it produces alot more 
detailed info for stats analysis but alot of the info is not suited to sharing in public.
So I stripped down mysqlmymon.sh to create mysqlmymonlite.sh with aim of 
providing as much stats output as possible without revealing any private server 
sensitive information as possible. 

Thus mysqlmymonlite.sh was born and is used mainly for vBulletin server 
optimisation requests on public forums providing nginx, apache, mysql, cpu, memory,
disk usage stats and general overview of server status in order to understand a 
vB client's server environment and loads. All this info takes less than <12 seconds 
to gather once the script is run.
